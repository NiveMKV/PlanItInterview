# PlanItInterview

Scripted all the three test cases in Selenium - C# with Nunit framework and integrated the codes to Github Actions as part of CI/CD.
It does run in the GitHub Actions when a pull request is made to 'main' branch but it fails at Build step but works fine in local environment.

Have tried many fixes but couldn't arrive at a solution in a given time. That's the part left incomplete in the assessment. Others work fine.
